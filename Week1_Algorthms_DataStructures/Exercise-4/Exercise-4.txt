1. Understand Array Representation

Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that once the memory is allocated for an array, all its elements are stored next to each other in memory. This allows for efficient indexing because you can compute the address of any element using its index.

Advantages:
Constant Time Access (O(1)): Arrays provide constant-time access to elements via indexing. This is due to the direct computation of memory addresses.
Simple and Efficient Storage: Arrays are simple to implement and use, with no overhead for storing additional information about the elements or their order.
Efficient Iteration: Traversing through an array is very efficient because the elements are stored contiguously, leading to predictable memory access patterns that are cache-friendly.

2. Setup and Implementation:

public class EmployeeManagementSystem {

    // Employee class to represent individual employees
    public static class Employee {
        private int employeeId;
        private String name;
        private String position;
        private double salary;

        // Constructor
        public Employee(int employeeId, String name, String position, double salary) {
            this.employeeId = employeeId;
            this.name = name;
            this.position = position;
            this.salary = salary;
        }

        // Getters and Setters
        public int getEmployeeId() { return employeeId; }
        public void setEmployeeId(int employeeId) { this.employeeId = employeeId; }
        public String getName() { return name; }
        public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
        public String getPosition() { return position; }
        public void setPosition(String position) { this.position = position; }
        public double getSalary() { return salary; }
        public void setSalary(double salary) { this.salary = salary; }

        // Override toString for better representation
        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Employee ID: " + employeeId + ", Name: " + name + ", Position: " + position + ", Salary: $" + salary;
        }
    }

    // EmployeeManagementSystem class to handle employee records
    private Employee[] employees;
    private int size; // Current number of employees in the array

    // Constructor
    public EmployeeManagementSystem(int capacity) {
        employees = new Employee[capacity];
        size = 0;
    }

    // Add an employee
    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        if (size < employees.length) {
            employees[size++] = employee;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Array is full. Cannot add more employees.");
        }
    }

    // Search for an employee by ID
    public Employee searchEmployeeById(int employeeId) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (employees[i].getEmployeeId() == employeeId) {
                return employees[i];
            }
        }
        return null; // Employee not found
    }

    // Traverse and display all employees
    public void traverseEmployees() {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            System.out.println(employees[i]);
        }
    }

    // Delete an employee by ID
    public boolean deleteEmployeeById(int employeeId) {
        int indexToDelete = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (employees[i].getEmployeeId() == employeeId) {
                indexToDelete = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (indexToDelete == -1) {
            return false; // Employee not found
        }

        // Shift elements to fill the gap
        for (int i = indexToDelete; i < size - 1; i++) {
            employees[i] = employees[i + 1];
        }
        employees[size - 1] = null; // Clear the last element
        size--;
        return true; // Employee successfully deleted
    }

    // Main method to demonstrate functionality
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmployeeManagementSystem ems = new EmployeeManagementSystem(5);

        // Add employees
        ems.addEmployee(new Employee(1, "John Doe", "Software Engineer", 80000));
        ems.addEmployee(new Employee(2, "Jane Smith", "Project Manager", 90000));
        ems.addEmployee(new Employee(3, "Alice Johnson", "UX Designer", 75000));

        // Traverse employees
        System.out.println("All Employees:");
        ems.traverseEmployees();

        // Search for an employee
        System.out.println("\nSearching for Employee with ID 2:");
        Employee employee = ems.searchEmployeeById(2);
        System.out.println(employee != null ? employee : "Employee not found");

        // Delete an employee
        System.out.println("\nDeleting Employee with ID 2:");
        boolean deleted = ems.deleteEmployeeById(2);
        System.out.println(deleted ? "Employee deleted successfully" : "Employee not found");

        // Traverse employees after deletion
        System.out.println("\nEmployees after deletion:");
        ems.traverseEmployees();
    }
}

3. Analysis:

Time Complexity:
Add Operation: O(1) 
Search Operation: O(n)
Traverse Operation: O(n)
Delete Operation: O(n)

Limitations of Arrays:
Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, so if you need to add more employees than the array can accommodate, you must resize the array (which is costly). Dynamic data structures like ArrayList can handle resizing more gracefully.
Inefficient Deletion: Deleting elements requires shifting elements, which can be inefficient. For frequent deletions, a data structure that supports efficient removal, like a linked list or a hash table, might be better.
Search Performance: Searching is linear in arrays. For faster searches, consider using hash-based data structures (e.g., HashMap) or sorting the array and using binary search.

When to Use Arrays:
-Arrays are suitable when the number of elements is known ahead of time and changes infrequently.
-Arrays are memory efficient compared to some dynamic structures due to their contiguous memory allocation.
-Arrays are a good choice for simple applications with straightforward indexing and traversal needs.
